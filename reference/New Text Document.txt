We need this: 
Main Page(kinda)
-to navigate the talent

Startup Page:
-the first user to see before going to main page

Animations:
-we need a specific css or js file to make it and make everything lively

Talents Page:
-a specific page for every talents

Lyrics Page:
-lyrics of course
-a lyrics page must contain the video song(we will use youtube here) that
autoplays when the user are directed to the page
-below the video is the details about the song(Title, cover or orig, romanji, eng,kanji name, composers and singer)
-a scrollable lyrics body to avoid user to scroll back in the top
-the functionality of the lyrics body for accessability based on the user's
preference(only applied in one site and back to default when user go back to other page)
