Majority of the member's songs are incomplete since I am not sure if I can include 
some of them but let's ask other persons if we have to add something


Holy Trinity Of Confusion:
sora = full of short ver and confusion between original and cover because of japanese
characters. Also her use of casual titles made it confusing. 
(wait, what? 70songs? are you kidding me)

robocco = well.

azki = I am not familiar with her so yeh 

Honorable Mention:
matsuri = bro. 



Kinda Hard:
fubuki = she has many covers but I dont if we should include the collabs outside the 
hololive

watame = many songs, not that confusing tho 

haachama = should we include short songs? Should we seperate Haato from Haachama?(Where tf
is your banner)

polka = ummm should we include the PO, I mean that's kinda funny tho

nene = nenenenenenenenenenenenenene.

A-chan = she sang in robocco song, soooo, should we include or not? I don't know, maybe?

Yagoo = ?
